## **Introduction**

<u>This repository contains lab exercises and assignments focused on Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented in Java.</u>  
Each folder is committed to a particular data structure or algorithm, replete with Java code samples, explanations, and additional resources for deeper understanding.

## **Getting Started**

These instructions will guide you in obtaining a copy of this repository for running the exercises on your local machine for learning purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you proceed, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE), e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- Basic understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/DataStructures-Algorithms.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
    ```bash
    cd DataStructures-Algorithms
    ```

3. **Compile and Run**  
    Navigate to the specific folder concerning a topic to find instructions for compiling and running the Java code.

## **Usage**

Each directory includes its own README or documentation detailing the learning objectives, tasks, and evaluation criteria for the exercises. Make sure to review these files before starting your work.

**Example:**

To run a program dealing with linked lists:
    ```bash
    cd linked_lists
    javac LinkedList.java
    java LinkedList
    ```
